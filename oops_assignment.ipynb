        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In oop classes are blueprint/template for creating object.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - In oop an object is an instance of a Class, it contains properties and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - The main difference between abstraction and encapsulation is abstraction focuses on what an object does, while encapsulation focuses on how an object's data is accessed and manipulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods are the methods defined by built-in classes in python. In dunder 'd' stands for Double and 'under' stands for Underscore, means all the methods surrounding double underscore is a dunder method.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in oops reffers to the process of child class receiving the properties of parent class. A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or child class, while the class it inherits from is called a superclass or parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - In polymorphism 'poly' means Many and 'morphism' means forms/states. It refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods/data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers to limit access to a class's variables and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class. Its main role is to initialize the object by setting up its attributes or state.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - In python class method is the method that takes the class itself as the first argument, and static method is the method which can be called without creating any intance of class. Class method to be used when we want to modify class level data, but static method to be used when we don't want to intract with class level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Python does not support true method overloading. It allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. Method overloading happens in the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method in parent class and child class with same signature(method), the child class method will be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - Property decorator allows class method to be accessed as atribute. It is use to turn class methods into properties.It is define as @property\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - In oop polymorphism is important because it allows for code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - In python abstract class may contain methods that are just declared and not implemented in acstract class itself, subclass are responsible for implementing these abstract methods. Abstract class should always be subclassed.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Oop has many advantages like resuability, encapsulation, polimorphism, modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   - The difference between a class variable and an instance variable is a class variable can be accessed using the class name or object but a instance variable can be accessed only through an object of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - In python multiple inheritance allows one child class may inherit the property of multiple parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__\" and \"__repr__\" methods in Python.\n",
        "  - In python '__str__' which return a string repesentation of abject, and '__repr__' it return unambiguous string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the \"super()\" function in Python?\n",
        "  - The 'super()' function in python is a built-in function that allows access to methods and properties of a parent class from a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - In python '__del__' method called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python is in @classmethod we can access and modify class level atribute/state but @staticmethod we cannot access. In @classmethod the first argument is cls but in @staticmethod has no first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance works by allowing a child class to have a method with the same name as a parent class method, and then redefining that method in the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - In python oop method chaining is a technique for calling multiple methods on an object in a single line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - In python '__call__' will be executed as the object if the class will be called as function.\n",
        "\n"
